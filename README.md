  ## How to Use YouTube Anywhere Remote
 You can choose which YouTube video you want to control by moving its tab to the left of all other YouTube videos.  
 This will even work for multiple windows! If you switched browser windows and the extension is still controlling the wrong video, just refresh the page or rearrange the tabs in your new window. The extension will automatically start controlling the YouTube video in the correct window.
 
 ## Installation
### [Get YouTube Anywhere Remote from the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-anywhere-remote/hjimacdiplfkaobglkdgkmhlamjjlnik?hl=en-US&authuser=3)
(A quick and easy installation can also be done via the Chrome store. Keep in mind, releases posted to the github page typically take 2-3 days to get accepted by Google in the Chrome store.)  
  
 Alternatively, here's how to install it manually from the github page: 
 1. Download the release under `"Releases"` on the right hand side of this page and extract the zip file.  
 2. In Chrome, go to the Extensions page. (To get there, click on the dotted menu icon at the top right of your browser and under `"More tools"` click on `"Extensions"`)  
 3. Once on the Extensions page, make sure "Developer Mode" is turned on on the top right corner of the screen.  
 4. Then click on `"Load unpacked"`, and navigate to the place you extracted the zip file. Select the folder you extracted the zip file's contents to, and click "Select folder" to install the extension.
 
 ## Setting Up Shortcuts
 After installing, click on the menu at the top left of the Extensions page and click on `"Keyboard shortcuts"`.  
 Here you can easily choose whatever shortcuts are most comfortable for you for each feature.
 
 **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to switch `"In Chrome"` to `"Global"` if you want to use features while you're using other programs or have your browser minimized.
